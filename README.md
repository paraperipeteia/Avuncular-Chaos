## Avuncular Chaos - A game-jam game about a drunken, farting uncle hitting the dance floor!

### What's there to know? 
I've only ran this locally via localhost, but might get it running on my website soon to archive it and make it easier for others to access 

### Gameplay
Very simple: You drink found beers, these give you farts. You must fart on the disco-dance-floor 'ravers' to keep them away from you. If you don't, it's game over, man. 

### CONTROLS

F - Fart

Enter - Start/Pause/Restart

Up, Down, Left, Right - Movement keys 

#### Credits:
Art (whiteboard drawings, digital colouring) - Me

Music (sequencing in Rytmik Studio) - Me 

Programming (JS, P5 library, HTML) - Me

SFX - Not Me. Probably culled from random sources - I really don't remember now.  

#### *** 2024 Notes ***
I cleaned up a couple of errors. 

Fixed up the audio so it's not too loud. 

Fixed movement so the character ("The Avalanche") will continue to face left if you've moved left. 

Fixed some movement restrictions so you can touch the lower, left and right canvas bounds and collect some items that spawn at these extremities (should be able to, anyway).  

What else... cleaned up the file structure a little and left in the original art work that was photographed then colored digitally to create the game sprites.

Not much else to say, it was indeed a brief creation and is reflective of that!
